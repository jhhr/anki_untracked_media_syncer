This addon will automatically sync untracked (prefixed with _) media files that have been edited since last sync.

Normally merely editing an untracked file will not cause it to be uploaded on sync.

# How to use

- Install addon
- Now, whenever you sync in Anki, edited files in the collection.media folder will be uploaded to AnkiWeb as well.
