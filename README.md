This addon will automatically sync untracked (prefixed with _) media files that have been edited since last sync.

Normally merely editing an untracked file will not cause it to be uploaded on sync.

# How to use

- Install addon
- Now, whenever you sync in Anki, edited files in the collection.media folder will be uploaded to AnkiWeb as well.

## Possible conflicts, if you edit in two places at once before syncing

The first to sync and upload to Ankiweb wins - those files will be downloaded and overwrite the others as you sync on other devices.
