This addon makes edited files in the collection.media folder get uploaded to AnkiWeb on sync.

# How to use

- Install addon
- Edit files, sync to upload.

## Possible conflicts, if you edit in two places at once before syncing

The first to sync and upload to Ankiweb wins - those files will be downloaded and overwrite the others as you sync on other devices.
